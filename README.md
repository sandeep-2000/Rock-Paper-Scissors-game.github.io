Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Python Project
The object of the rock-paper-scissor python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with a computer, anywhere, and anytime. This project is base on the rules that:

rock blunts scissors so rock wins
scissors cut the paper so scissors win
paper cover rock so paper wins
This project is build using tkinter, random modules, and the basic concept of python.


In this python project, players have to choose any one from rock, paper, and scissors. Then click on the play button will show the result of the game.

Project Prerequisites
To implement this python rock paper scissors project we will use the basic concept of python with tkinter and random module.

Tkinter is a standard GUI library which is one of the easiest ways to build a GUI application.
random module use to generate random numbers
To install the libraries we can use the pip installer command on the command prompt:

1.pip install tkinter
2.pip install random
